# So, you want to see what ShowBase hides from you concerning setting
# everything up from the scene graph to the windowing and rendering API?
# Let's take a look. We will start at the latter and build towards the
# former, and then switch over to the former and let the pieces meet up
# in the middle.
# And yes, there is method to this madness.

# First, we need to know what graphics pipelines (OpenGL, DirectX,
# Vulkan, etc.) are available on the system.
selection = GraphicsPipeSelection.getGlobalPtr()
# NOTES
# * Some methods of interest:
#   selection.print_pipe_types()
#   selection.get_num_pipe_types()
#   selection.get_pipe_types()
#   selection.get_pipe_type(0)


# Then we need to create an instance of at least one of the pipelines.
# It is possible to create one instance of each.
# A pipeline is an abstraction of the OS' windowing system and graphics
# API. Which pipeline is the default one is set in Config.prc and
# accessed transparently here.
pipe = selection.make_default_pipe()
# NOTES
# * Pipelines of non-default type can be made like this:
#   selection.make_module_pipe('pandagl')
# * It should be possible to create more than one instance of one pipe.
#   Use case: Multiple X11 display servers
# * More methods of interest:
#   pipe.get_type().get_name()
#   pipe.get_interface_name()


# Now we need a window to draw to, for which we need the graphics
# engine. It is a factory for graphics outputs (both visible and
# invisible framebuffers, and the windows that are used to display the
# former; n.b.: There's the intermediate step of the drawing region,
# explained later), and used to manage the process of rendering, which
# means iterating over all buffers (display regions) and rendering them.
# As such, it also manages the threading model used for rendering.
graphics_engine = GraphicsEngine()
# NOTES
# * The graphics engine is typically a singleton:
#   graphics_engine = GraphicsEngine.getGlobalPtr()


# So, let's create a window! This will also create a few things
# implicitly:
# * A framebuffer. This is a set of images stored in memory, each
#   consisting of a set of channels; red, green, blue, transparency,
#   depth, and so on.
#   By default, a window's framebuffer will have two images, the front
#   buffer and the back buffer. The Why of this will be explained below,
#   after rendering the frame.
# * A graphics state guardian (GSG), which is the abstraction of the
#   graphics API. Panda3D will "draw" to the GSG, and it in turn will
#   issue the actual draw commands to the driver, and transmit resources
#   like meshes, textures, and shaders to it. For that, the GSG needs
#   prepared graphics objects (PGO), which are resources that have been
#   processed for the GPU's consumption. More on that in the rendering
#   section as well.
#   Several buffers can share the same GSG (by passing it as an
#   additional argument to graphics_engine.make_output()), and thus the
#   same PGOs, resulting in an efficient reuse of resources. The only
#   reason to use several GSGs is when you absolutely, positively, need
#   to isolate graphics resources from each other, for instance when
#   writing to GSGs from different threads.
#   GSGs also store a reference to the Loader from which they draw their
#   resources. This they get from the GraphicsEngine upon creation.
fbprops = FrameBufferProperties.getDefault()
wprops = WindowProperties.getDefault()
flags = GraphicsPipe.BFFbPropsOptional | GraphicsPipe.BFRequireWindow
sort = 0
window = graphics_engine.make_output(pipe, "name", sort, fbprops, wprops, flags)
# NOTES
# * `graphics_engine.make_buffer()` is a syntactic sugar for
#   `.make_output()` that you give an already existing output to, so
#   that as many resources as possible are shared automatically (i.e.
#   the GSG), and the same framebuffer properties are applied.
#   `.make_parasite()` is similarly syntactic sugar.
# * Outputs can be set active or inactive, which controls whether they
#   will be refreshed when the frame is rendered. There's a convenience
#   method that makes them active only for the next frame.


# Let's recapitulate what exists now:
# * A Graphics State Guardian
#   * managing Prepared Graphics Objects
#   * writing commands to the graphics pipeline
# * A window with framebuffers
# * The graphics engine with which we created the window
#
# And now for something completely different: The scene graph.
# The scene graph is a directed acyclic graph where each node is related
# to its parent by a spatial transformation (consisting of translation,
# rotation, and scale), and a selection of render attributes that
# influence how it is rendered. That relation is expressed in the
# nodepath, representing the path from the node to its parent.
#
# Okay, that was a mouthful, let's break it down a bit.
# First, let's say that the scene graph is a tree data structure; While
# not correct, it's true enough.
# The edges between nodes are, in Panda3D, `NodePath`s, and they express
# where the node is when considering the parent as defining a coordinate
# space.
# A `NodePath` may contain nodes, which may be geometry, cameras, or any
# other kind that may occur in an application's world.
#
# We start creating our scene with a nodepath containing a `PandaNode`,
# which in itself is a do-nothing node; It is only here for managerial
# purposes, and has the name "scene graph root".
scene_graph = NodePath("scene graph root")
# NOTE
# * Passing a string to `NodePath()` is syntactic sugar for
#   `NodePath(PandaNode('name'))`.
# * Since the scene graph is a DAG, and not a tree, there may be
#   multiple paths from the tree's root to any given node. Since on
#   these paths, different transformations may be applied and different
#   attributes may be set, there may be several ways for a node to be
#   rendered. To disambiguate them, NodePaths represent the individual
#   paths from root to node.
# FIXME
# * Is that correct?
# * Can I exemplify it? (see manual)

# To get anything visibly rendered, we need a camera in the scene graph.
# We also need to adjust its lens, so that the camera "records" the
# scene graph in the aspect ratio that its output will be displayed in.
camera = Camera("camera")
cam_node_path = scene_graph.attach_new_node(camera)
camera.get_lens().set_aspect_ratio(
    float(window.get_x_size()) /
    float(window.get_y_size())
)
# NOTES
#   The camera has only "by coincidence" the right lens type by default.
#     lens = PerspectiveLens()
#     camera.set_lens(lens)
#   camera = self.render.attach_new_node(ModelNode('camera'))
#   camera.node().setPreserveTransform(ModelNode.PTLocal)


# For purposes of rendering something interesting, and seeing that we
# have indeed set up everything correctly, we need to add a model to the
# scene and place it in front of the camera, so that we have something
# to actually look at.
# When assets are loaded, they are stored in resource pools, which are
# singletons that are created implicitly when used. Most pools store
# them only temporarily, until the resource is uploaded to VRAM, at
# which point it is removed from RAM. A reference to the file is
# retained, however, so that it can be reloaded, should it be removed
# from VRAM, but later is needed again.
loader = Loader.getGlobalPtr()
loader_options = LoaderOptions()
model = loader.load_sync(Filename("models/smiley"), loader_options)
model_node = NodePath(model)
model_node.reparent_to(scene_graph)
model_node.set_pos(0, 10, 0)

# And now we link scene graph and window together by creating a display
# region.
# A display region is simply the area of a window (or, more
# specifically, of a framebuffer) that a camera draws to. A window can
# have multiple display regions, arranged and stacked in arbitrary ways;
# they are merely mappings. By default, it covers the complete window
# area that the window has at the time that the display area is created.
# If the window size changes later on, the display region (and the
# underlying framebuffer) will have to be updated.
display_region = window.make_display_region()
display_region.set_camera(cam_node_path)
# NOTES
# * Currently, windows are created with a default display region, which
#   is probably just a hack. It shouldn't exist.
# * Even more methods of interest:
#   display_region.setSort(sort)
#   display_region.setClearDepthActive(1)
#   display_region.setClearColorActive(1)
#   display_region.setClearColor(clearColor)


# With everything in place now, it's time to render the scene.
# To render a frame means that the graphics engine will
# * flip the double-buffer. Rendering writes to the back-buffer, so
#   we're now presenting the results of the last frame's render, and
#   write into the buffer that is *not* displayed anymore. This is done
#   so that drawing happens off-screen, and in this order so as to
#   maximize the time that the GPU has to do the actual graphics
#   generation.
# * step through all windows
# * step through the window's display regions
# * find the root of the scene graph that the display region's camera
#   is in
# * perform culling
# * prepare the resources that are found to be needed, creating PGOs for
#   them. This can be preempted by calling node.prepareScene(gsg), for
#   instance during a loading screen.
# * issue the relevant draw calls to the window's GSG
#
# With all of this being done, the GPU can now draw the scene into the
# backbuffer without further attention of the CPU, and thus, as far as
# Panda3D and applications built on it are concerned, the frame has been
# rendered.
graphics_engine.render_frame()


# Now that the frame is stored in the backbuffer, it would be displayed
# automatically when the buffers are flipped again at the beginning of
# the next frame rendering.
# Since we're not in a hurry here, we'll flip the buffer explicitly.
# This is not representative of what Panda3D would or should do in
# production. If you still want it to, you can set "auto-flip true" in
# Config.prc to make the graphics engine flip the buffers after
# rendering the frame, instead of before it.
graphics_engine.flip_frame()

# TODO
# * Now break it all down again.
#   window.set_active(False)
#   display_region.set_camera(NodePath())
#   cam_node_path.remove_node()
#   window.remove_display_region(display_region)

#   # Now the window just vanishes? No rejection of props, or other error?
#   # <rdb> You don't directly modify properties; you "request" properties you
#   #       want to change, and then Panda kindly asks the window manager to
#   #       apply those the next time it gets the opportunity to do so.  If it
#   #       works, it updates get_properties().  If it does not work, it puts
#   #       the rejected properties in get_rejected_properties().
#   window.get_properties().set_title("foo")
#   TypeError: Cannot call WindowProperties.set_title() on a const object.
#   # Am I supposed to copy all other properties by hand into the new props?
