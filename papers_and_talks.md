### Behavior trees

* Parallelism in Behavior Trees
  * "Improving the Parallel Execution of Behavior Trees": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04898v1.pdf
    * Extends Behavior Trees by giving each node functions that report
      the node's current progress, and its use of resources.
    * Defines a `ParallelSync` node that routes ticks to the least
      progressed child tree.
    * Defines a `ParallelMutex` node that routes ticks to children with
      the highest priority (according to a policy that implements aging)
      as long as the necessary resources are available.
    * Both nodes, like the basic `Parallel`, fails if any child fails,
      succeeds when all children succeed, and otherwise remains active.
  * "Analysis and Exploitation of Synchronized Parallel Executions in
Behavior Trees": https://lornat75.github.io/papers/2019/colledanchise-iros.pdf
    * Builds on "Improving the Parallel Execution of Behavior Trees".
    * Defines `ParallelSyncAbsolute` that has a list of barrier values.
      If there are children with a progress below any given barrier, the
      children with progress equal to or above that barrier will no
      longer receive ticks.
    * Defines `ParallelSyncRelative` that ticks children so as to keep
      the slowest within a given range of the fastest.

### Utility AI

* Utility AI
  * The AI selects an Option from a set of Options, each of which have a set of Considerations.
  * The Considerations model aspects of the usefulness (utility) of the Option.
  * The weights of an Option's Considerations are multiplied, resulting in the Option's weight.
  * The selection can take many forms.
    * The final choice is usually done by weighted random selection.
    * To eliminate low-weight Options, the n highest-weighted Options can be pre-selected.
    * Alternatively, Options with a weight lower than x% of the highest-weighted Option can be eliminated.
* [Dual-Utility Reasoning](https://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter03_Dual-Utility_Reasoning.pdf)
  * "Absolute utility": AI chooses the option with the highest utility. Overly predictable.
  * "Relative utility": AI chooses randomly from weighted options. Overly random.
  * "Dual utility":
    * Options have rank and weight.
      * First, the Options with the highest rank with non-zero weight are selected.
      * Among those, one is chosen randomly, taking the weights into consideration.
      * Optionally, in the second step, Options with a weight significantly lower than the largest one can be eliminated.
    * Considerations have rank, weight, and bonus.
      * Typically there is a TuningConsideration with rank 0.0, weight 1.0, bonus 1.0.
      * An Option's rank is the highest rank among those of its Considerations.
      * An Option's weight is the product of the weights of the Considerations, times the sum of boni.
      * Except for the TuningConsideration, bonus is usually 0.0.
* [Design Patterns for the Configuration of Utility-Based AI](https://course.khoury.northeastern.edu/cs5150f13/readings/dill_designpatterns.pdf)
  * Based on the DualUtility Reasoner.
  * Introduces a set of Considerations with wide applicability in shaping utility-based behavior.

### HGN: Hierarchical Goal Networks

There should be some "transitional" papers here. The essence is: Goals can be decomposited into subgoals, just like HTN composes plans.


### Goal-Driven Autonomy

HGN can be augmented with mecanisms to monitor plan execution and to analyze and explain failures.

* [Goal-Driven Autonomy in Planning and Acting](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~munoz/gda/05.Goal-Driven.Autonomy.in.Planning.and.Acting.v3.pdf)
* [Hierarchical Goal Networks and Goal-Driven Autonomy: Going where AI Planning Meets Goal Reasoning](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/papers/shivashankar2013hierarchical.pdf)

* [Goal-Driven Autonomy in a Navy Strategy Simulation](http://matthewklenk.com/papers/AAAI-IS-10-GDA%20(Camera%20Ready,%20Final,%20bib).pdf)
* [Goal-driven Autonomy Without GDA](https://cs.unh.edu/~ruml/papers/no-gda-aaai-bridge-2023.pdf)
* [Is Everything Going According to Plan? - Expectations in Goal Reasoning Agents](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~munoz/Publications/AAAI19.pdf)
  Draws on the below thesis on Introspective Multistrategy Learning.
* [Expectation-Aware Planning: A Unifying Framework for Synthesizing and Executing Self-Explaining Plans for Human-Aware Planning](https://cdn.aaai.org/ojs/5634/5634-13-8859-1-10-20200512.pdf)


#### Rebel Agents

Agents can have mechanisms that make them reject or refine given goals; This is called rebellion.

* [A Rebellion Framework with Learning for Goal-Driven Autonomy](https://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3618&context=etd_all)
* [Rebel Agents That Adapt to Goal Expectation Failures](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10349752)
  * There may be reasons to reject the current goal; For example:
    * An observation makes a different course of action preferable, e.g. informing a human about the sighting of a dangerous animal.
    * A goal turns out to be unachievable.
  * Boggs, Dannenhauer, Floyd and Aha (2018)'s approach:
    * Given a world and goals, each goal is checked for achievability.
      * If it isn't achievable, it is discarded.
      * If it is achievable, it is fully planned and acted out.
      * If a goal is achievable, but undesirable (the action to achieve it results in a state of lower utility), the agent may rebel.
        * The agent has an inherent tendency to rebellion. Based on that, a probabilistic choice is made.
	* If the agent chooses to rebel, it informs its user and asks for permission.
	* If the human rejects the rebellion, the agent probabilistically chooses either to reject or comply with the humanâ€™s advice.
    * This paper replaces the probabilistic choice based on [MICDA](https://cdn.aaai.org/ojs/9886/9886-13-13414-1-2-20201228.pdf)
* [Explaining Rebel Behavior in Goal Reasoning Agents](https://dtdannen.github.io/faim2018grw/papers/ExplainingRebelBehaviorinGoalReasoningAgents.pdf)
* [Computational Models of Rebel Agent Behavior for Interactive Narrative](https://dtdannen.github.io/papers/aaai_fs_19.pdf)


### Introspective Multistrategy Learning

* [Introspective Multistrategy Learning: Constructing a Learning Strategy under Reasoning Failure](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA495211.pdf)
  In an AI where the reasoning / learning process is represented as
  knowledge, when a failure in the reasoning process is detected, the
  failure can be analyzed and repaired. This thesis does among other
  things define a taxonomy of error types, which other papers draw upon.
* [Introspective multistrategy learning: On the construction of learning strategies](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81111744.pdf)
* [An Empirical Study of Computational Introspection: Evaluating Introspective Multistrategy Learning in the Meta-AQUA System](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA316878.pdf#page=137)


### Search

* "Playing Your Cards Right: The Hierarchical Portfolio Search AI of Prismata": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQSL9j7W7uA
  * A refinement for general tree search.
  * The problem: Searching through all possible combinations of
    fundamental actions leads to a prohibitively high branching factor.
  * Designers create portfolios of behaviors, which, given a state,
    execute actions. During search, portfolios provide valid
    combinations of behaviors, with which successor states are then
    generated. The branching factor thus is the number of behavior
    combinations.
  * Portfolios can be tailored to cause desired behavior patterns.
* "Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of F.E.A.R.": http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf
  * A refinement of STRIPS planning.
  * Behaviors have preconditions that the state must fulfill for the
    behavior to be executable, and postconditions that will be fulfilled
    once the action is executed.
  * During search, behavior are concatenated into plans.

Petri Nets and Workflows
------------------------

Petri Nets are networks of Places, which can store markers, and
Transitions, which remove sets of markers from their input places, and
add markers to their output places. They are modeling systems similar to
how FSMs do it, and can algorithmically be transformed into FSMs, and
vice versa; They also can be tested algorithmically for possible
deadlocks and livelocks.

Workflows are a subset of Petri Nets, which find application in modeling
industrial processes.
