Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------

### Navigation

* Navmesh-less navigation in Hyper Scape using neural networks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKdQFajLfzk https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04764.pdf


### Behavior trees

* Parallelism in Behavior Trees
  * "Improving the Parallel Execution of Behavior Trees": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04898v1.pdf
    * Extends Behavior Trees by giving each node functions that report
      the node's current progress, and its use of resources.
    * Defines a `ParallelSync` node that routes ticks to the least
      progressed child tree.
    * Defines a `ParallelMutex` node that routes ticks to children with
      the highest priority (according to a policy that implements aging)
      as long as the necessary resources are available.
    * Both nodes, like the basic `Parallel`, fails if any child fails,
      succeeds when all children succeed, and otherwise remains active.
  * "Analysis and Exploitation of Synchronized Parallel Executions in
Behavior Trees": https://lornat75.github.io/papers/2019/colledanchise-iros.pdf
    * Builds on "Improving the Parallel Execution of Behavior Trees".
    * Defines `ParallelSyncAbsolute` that has a list of barrier values.
      If there are children with a progress below any given barrier, the
      children with progress equal to or above that barrier will no
      longer receive ticks.
    * Defines `ParallelSyncRelative` that ticks children so as to keep
      the slowest within a given range of the fastest.

### Search

* "Playing Your Cards Right: The Hierarchical Portfolio Search AI of Prismata": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQSL9j7W7uA
  * A refinement for general tree search.
  * The problem: Searching through all possible combinations of
    fundamental actions leads to a prohibitively high branching factor.
  * Designers create portfolios of behaviors, which, given a state,
    execute actions. During search, portfolios provide valid
    combinations of behaviors, with which successor states are then
    generated. The branching factor thus is the number of behavior
    combinations.
  * Portfolios can be tailored to cause desired behavior patterns.
* "Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of F.E.A.R.": http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf
  * A refinement of STRIPS planning.
  * Behaviors have preconditions that the state must fulfill for the
    behavior to be executable, and postconditions that will be fulfilled
    once the action is executed.
  * During search, behavior are concatenated into plans.

Petri Nets and Workflows
------------------------

Petri Nets are networks of Places, which can store markers, and
Transitions, which remove sets of markers from their input places, and
add markers to their output places. They are modeling systems similar to
how FSMs do it, and can algorithmically be transformed into FSMs, and
vice versa; They also can be tested algorithmically for possible
deadlocks and livelocks.

Workflows are a subset of Petri Nets, which find application in modeling
industrial processes.
